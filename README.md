# WhatsApp Stickers

This is a collection of some stickers I like in Telegram and are not available in the iOS yet.

Basically this is the example App from WhatsApp, with minimal changes.

Just checkout and run on your iPhone, you don't need a Developer Account to run on your iPhone [Deploying to a Device without an Apple Developer Account](https://blog.ionicframework.com/deploying-to-a-device-without-an-apple-developer-account/).
